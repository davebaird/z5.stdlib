# z5.stdlib

Note: this library auto-updates itself, so you should fork or export, rather than
clone, if you don't want arbitrary code uploaded to your server on my whim.

Usage:

    #!/bin/bash
    source [/path/to/z5.stdlib]/sh/importer strict || exit 1
    import errcho
    import pathtools
    ...
